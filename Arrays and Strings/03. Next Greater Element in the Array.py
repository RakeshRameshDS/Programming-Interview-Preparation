"""
Given an array of integers(positive or negative), print the next greater element of all elements in the array. If there is no greater element then print null.
Next greater element of an array element array[i], is an integer array[j], such that
1. array[i] is less than array[j]
2. i is less than j
3. j - i is minimum
i.e. array[j] is the first element on the right of array[i] which is greater than array[i].
